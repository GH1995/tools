词根
- 自由词根(本族语)
- 粘附词根
  - 拉丁词根(拉丁语) → 一般用语
  - 希腊词根(希腊语) → 科技术语

构词形态变化：
1). 字母增加
· 重读闭音节词根+后缀——尾辅音字母重写
· 古典语词根+后缀或派生词——添加-o-(希腊词根)或-i-(拉丁词根)
· 保持词根词尾元音字母读长音——添加-e-，使之成为长音节
2). 字母减少
· 添加后缀时保持音值——去掉-e
· 前缀词尾辅音与词根首字母重合——常见于去掉-s
3). 字母变更
拉丁动词词根变化规律：
[b], [p], [k], [g]... → [t]
  b → pt
  p → pt
  g → ct[kt]
  c[k] → ct[kt]
  sc, x → (c)t
  v → (u)t
  m → mpt
[t], [d] → [s]

词缀
- 本族语词缀
  · 屈折词缀(表示语法关系)：-s(复数)，-ed(过去式)，-ing(进行态)，-er(比较级)，-est(最高级)
  · 派生词缀(起粘附作用，只能加在单词词基上而不能与词根词素缀合。)
- 外来词缀/借用词缀/新古典词缀(对外来语词缀的正字即将其简化成本族语词缀的模样)
  · 拉丁词缀
  · 希腊词缀
or

一般来说，词根重读，词缀轻读。
例外：
1. 表否定派生前缀un-, non-重读；
2. 双音节前缀原生词由动词转化为名词或形容词时，重音由词根转移到前缀；
3. 借用的派生词缀与词根一起重读，以区别与原生词缀；
4. 词根性质前缀post-, self-, semi-等往往重读；
5. 个别后缀-ee, -ese, -esque, -ette等往往重读；
6. 个别后缀-ian, -ic, -ion, -ity等使重音落在自己前一个音节；
7. 其他个例如differ, common, comfort等。
